I added the abs(value) in BufHash

I made the code more efficent, double check with david to make sure I didnt remove anything

Make sure we still basically have the same things, just mine is more efficent (same if checks same return values when needed )

Remove the comments on top of the methods

Maybe submit if your feeling confident


Check anhai piazza post, he updated the hash function, and I changed it on our hash function, so we should be good
